# Pre-commit hooks for code quality and security
# Updated: 2025-01-04

# Pre-commit is integrated into the development
#   workflow but not currently activated. It's configured
#    in:
#    
#   - requirements-dev.txt:30 and pyproject.toml:77 as
#   dependencies
#   - Makefile:81-83 with install and run commands
#   - Makefile:46 included in the setup process
# 
#   The hooks check code formatting (Black, isort),
#   quality (flake8), security (bandit, safety), and
#   Docker linting. To activate, run make pre-commit or
# pre-commit install.
