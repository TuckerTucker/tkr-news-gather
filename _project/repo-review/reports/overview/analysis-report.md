### Module Boundaries & Interfaces

**Excellent Separation:**
- **`src/news/`**: Domain-specific news processing logic with clear interfaces
- **`src/utils/`**: Infrastructure and cross-cutting concerns
- **`database/`**: Data persistence layer with multiple schema variants
- **`tests/`**: Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and factories

**Clean Interfaces:**
- Each module exports specific functionality through well-defined `__init__.py` files
- Dependency injection through centralized configuration classes
- Async context managers for proper resource management
- Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure concerns

---

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. **Layered Architecture**
- **Presentation Layer**: FastAPI endpoints with Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **Business Logic Layer**: NewsGatherAPI orchestrating domain operations
- **Data Access Layer**: SupabaseClient and LocalStorage abstractions
- **External Integration Layer**: GoogleNewsClient, ArticleScraper, AnthropicClient

### 2. **Service-Oriented Design**
- Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Services are composed through dependency injection
- Clean async interfaces throughout the application
- Loose coupling between components

### 3. **Factory Pattern**
- Extensive use of factory patterns in test fixtures (`ArticleFactory`, `ProcessedArticleFactory`)
- Configuration factory for different environments
- AI personality factories for different content processing styles

### 4. **Repository Pattern**
- SupabaseClient abstracts database operations
- LocalStorage provides file-system persistence alternative
- Clean separation between data access and business logic

### 5. **Strategy Pattern**
- Multiple AI host personalities (anchor, friend, newsreel) with different processing strategies
- Different deployment strategies (local, Docker, serverless)
- Pluggable news sources and scrapers

### 6. **Async Context Manager Pattern**
- ArticleScraper uses async context managers for resource management
- Proper cleanup of browser instances and connections
- Exception-safe resource handling
